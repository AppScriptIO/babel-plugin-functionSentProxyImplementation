### TODO:
- Fix tests that were copied from the official Babel respository. Check: 
  - https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/scripts/test.sh
  - https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/Makefile

- Support Symbols as function names. Curretly the symbol names are replaced with an arbitrary string name (e.g. `_ref8`)
